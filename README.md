# CampGIS

The legality around dispersed camping is confusing, even for experienced campers. CampGIS aims to address this problem by integrating public land boundaries, MVUM access rules, proximities to roads and water, and other environmental constraints into a centralized, map-based tool. Using spatial querying, CampGIS will construct a legality confidence layer (e.g., No, Maybe, Most Likely), along with information outlining the reasoning behind each classification.
